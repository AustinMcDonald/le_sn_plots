# le_sn_plots

Save data used in the plots as a ".npy" file and drop it into the datafiles folder. 

e.g. 
np.save("some_plot_data.npy", np.array([data1, data2, ... datan]))

then in a note book just import what is needed and make the plot. 

for an example look at the Efficiency_V_NeutrinoEnergy.ipynb
